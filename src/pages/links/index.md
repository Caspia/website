Caspia is not the only one of several cooperative efforts in Washington prisons to teach coding. Other efforts include:
#### [University Beyond Bars](http://www.universitybeyondbars.org/)
Most of my work is done as a class sponsored by University Beyond Bars (UBB) at the Washington State Reformatory in Monroe, WA. In
addition to my technical seminar, UBB offers typically one other class in computing taught by an Amazon employee.
#### [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org/)
Unloop is an organization based in Seattle, Washington that teaches coding classes at several Washington state prisons, as well as
providing industry contacts.
#### [Peninsula College](https://www.pencol.edu/)
The Peninsula College branch in the Clallam Bay prison has been teaching computing classes for several years, focused initially
on game design. Out of the effort has some an exciting project to make laptops available to students, with a secure hardware
and software under the [Open Prison Education (OPE)](https://github.com/operepo/ope) effort.
